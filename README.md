# Physical-Activity-Tracker-using-Vitality-Signatures
We investigate how different physiological activities change ourÂ Heart Rate and SpO2 values and created a prototype for activity tracking.

Please refer to repository : Vitals-Classification-Data-Preparation/create_dataset/DS_data_group_18.ipynb to understand how data was pre-processed. Further, one can also look into the Exploratory Data Analysis done on the dataset in the same notebook.
